[{"content":"Problem Most Sudoku tools are either GUI toys or online apps. I wanted a fast, scriptable command-line tool that could:\nGenerate valid Sudoku puzzles with a unique solution Offer different difficulty levels Solve arbitrary Sudoku boards reliably Integrate into scripts, tests, and small tooling workflows At the same time, I wanted a concrete project to practice algorithm design, search, and constraint reasoning in Go.\nApproach I built a terminal-based Sudoku tool in Go that supports both generation and solving from the command line.\nThe CLI accepts flags for: --generate with optional difficulty (e.g. easy, medium, hard) --solve to read a puzzle from stdin or a file --format to output in a machine-friendly or human-readable grid Internally, the solver uses a backtracking search combined with constraint-based pruning (row/column/subgrid checks) to cut down the search space.
