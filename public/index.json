I wanted a fast, scriptable command-line tool that could:\nGenerate valid Sudoku puzzles with a unique solution Offer different difficulty levels Solve arbitrary Sudoku boards reliably Integrate into scripts, tests, and small tooling workflows At the same time, I wanted a concrete project to practice algorithm design, search, and constraint reasoning in Go.\nApproach I built a terminal-based Sudoku tool in Go that supports both generation and solving from the command line.\nThe CLI accepts flags for: --generate with optional difficulty (e.g. easy, medium, hard) --solve to read a puzzle from stdin or a file --format to output in a machine-friendly or human-readable grid Internally, the solver uses a backtracking search combined with constraint-based pruning (row/column/subgrid checks) to cut down the search space. The generator creates a full valid board, then removes clues while: Maintaining a unique solution (checked by running the solver) Stopping when difficulty constraints are reached (max branching, number of givens, etc.) Technical Highlights Backtracking Solver\nDepth-first search with early pruning when row/column/subgrid constraints are violated Deterministic behavior with optional seeding for reproducible runs Detects unsolvable or invalid puzzles and exits with a clear error code Puzzle Generation\nStarts from a fully solved board generated via the same solver Removes numbers while: Checking that the puzzle still has exactly one solution Enforcing minimum clue counts per difficulty tier Uses randomized removal order so generated puzzles are not identical CLI Design\nBuilt with the standard library (no heavy dependencies) Clear usage help and error messages Can read puzzles from: Standard input Text files in a simple 9×9 ASCII format (e.g. 0 or . for blanks) Testing \u0026amp; Reliability\nUnit tests for: Solver correctness on known puzzles Uniqueness detection Generator invariants (always solvable) Fuzz-style tests that: Generate random puzzles Solve them Re-validate the solved board’s constraints Results Generates valid Sudoku puzzles with a guaranteed unique solution. Solves typical puzzles in milliseconds on a normal machine. Can be used both: Interactively in the terminal As part of other tools or scripts (e.g. benchmarking, teaching examples, coding exercises) This project is now my go-to example for:\nImplementing search and constraint algorithms in Go Writing testable command-line tools Demonstrating how to move from a simple idea to a robust, scriptable utility What I’d Improve Next Implement more advanced solving strategies (e.g. naked pairs, X-Wing) to rate difficulty more accurately. Expose the core solver as a Go library with a clean API for reuse in other projects. Add a --benchmark mode to measure solve times across multiple puzzles. Optional TUI (text UI) for interactive play without leaving the terminal.
