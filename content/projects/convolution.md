[![Convolution Visualizer Graph](/images/projects/convolution/graph.png)](https://rybkr.github.io/convolution-visualizer/)

Convolution is a core operation in circuit analysis and signal processing, but it’s often taught as a formula first and an idea second.
I built this visualizer to make the mechanics explicit: time reversal, shifting, overlap, and accumulation are shown graphically and updated in real time.
No black boxes, no hand-waving.
The site also contains a brief writeup explaining what a convolution is and how to perform one mathematically.
