ChromaSudoku is a compact Sudoku implementation for the RP2350, replacing numbers with distinct colors for a simple, hardware-friendly UI.
The project focuses on clear input handling, clean C logic, and minimal rendering for constrained devices.

## Technical Summary
- Written in C with PlatformIO for fast iteration.
- Color mapping replaces numerical display requirements.
- Designed for low-memory hardware with simple I/O.
