I'm a software engineer focused on systems programming and education. I build tools that make complex ideas tangible—whether that's a [convolution visualizer](/projects/convolution/) that turns signal processing into something you can see and manipulate, or a [C++ curriculum](/teaching/writing/) that treats fundamentals with the rigor they deserve.

## What I Do

Most of my work lives at the intersection of **building** and **teaching**. I write performant code in C++, Go, and C, and I spend a lot of time thinking about how to explain the ideas behind that code clearly.

I've given [talks](/teaching/talks/) at conferences, written [technical guides](/teaching/writing/) covering C++ from basics to templates and memory safety, and built [open-source tools](/projects/) ranging from chess engines to embedded games.

## Technical Interests

- **Systems programming**: Low-level performance, memory management, build systems
- **Developer tools**: CLI utilities, editor configurations, workflow automation
- **Embedded systems**: Microcontrollers, hardware interfaces, resource-constrained environments
- **Technical education**: Making difficult concepts accessible without oversimplifying

## Currently

Building software and educational content. Previously worked on projects involving machine learning infrastructure and developer tooling.
